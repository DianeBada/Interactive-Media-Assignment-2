        What is interactivity and how does it work on the WWW?
        <br><br>

The term interactivity can be described as the process of allowing information to be passed with no breaks in both direction between a computer/device and the person who uses it (Oxford Dictionary, 2022). This term derived from the Oxford dictionary describes the usual occurrence that everyone goes through today. Interactivity is always taking place, whether we are posting on social media, watching a music video on YouTube, or just simply interacting with the internet.
<br>
I think back to high school where we were assigned to create websites for that reflected ourselves, from our hobbies to family to achievements, similar to what we’re doing now. My website was static and had no element of interactivity. All one could do was click on different links that led to different pages. Nothing special. This links back to how the web used to be back then, with Web 1.0 and Web 2.0. These were static and read-only websites. Then the web slowly developed and Web 3.0 and with this it introduced some dynamic elements, provision of information and the analyzation of data according to the user’s data, such as how related information will find you based on your search history (C# corner, 2022).
<br><br>
So, how does interactivity work on the WWW?
<br><br>
In terms of web design, the web is meant to attract users and entice them to engage with the page. An example of interactive elements found on the web are things like radio buttons, hyperlinks etc (Verizon, 2021). Also, giving users choice and agency in how they navigate the website, also allows for interactivity. But why should developers care about interactivity? When users interact with the web, they want things to be straightforward and simple. Interactivity allows for users to personalise their experience through the submission of their data. It allows for users to keep coming back and allows for easy capture of user experience (Verizon, 2021).
I personally think interactivity is important especially in this fast-paced world. I would never really visit a site if I knew that my first experience with it was tedious and boring. As humans we like being kept on our toes and like feeling like we have been heard. The web is constantly evolving and hence we should be able to feel even though it is, we are still catered for and not left behind. That’s why it is important to always evaluate one’s page. Does it still accommodate for user’s experience and still make users feel as they are given the choices?
