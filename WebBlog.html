        What is a browser and how does it work?
        <br><br>


Let’s start here, a browser is an application program that facilitates in interacting with all content that is present on the World Wide Web (TechTarget, 2022). So, everything that one interacts with, such as pictures, social media and so and so, is the web browser doing us a favour and making pathways to meet.
<br>
The world-wide web (WWW) is a combination of all resources and users on the internet that are connected using Hypertext (TechTarget, 2022). Just imagine a library and all the books stored there, the WWW works like that too, except that all interrelated works are usually grouped together and can be found easily than going around looking for specific books.
<br>
 A web browser is a client program that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). The role of an HTTP is that it makes requests to the servers throughout the internet on behalf of the browser user (TechTarget, 2022). 
So how does a browser work? 
It works as a part of a client/server model. The client is the browser which run on the user’s device and makes request to the Web server, while the server side is the Web server which sends information back to the browser. It’s quite simple really. When I think of client/server, it’s easy to remember that clients usually request something, and servers “serve” the clients. The browser then interprets and displays the information on the user’s device (TechTarget, 2022).
<br>
The browser consists of several interworking parts. This includes the UI, the browser engine, Java Script interpreter which is all technical but not difficult to understand.
The UI is the level in which the user interacts with the browser, we are led by the visuals that we see on the screen.  The browser engine is what queries the rendering engine, as a result the rendering engine is what gives the requested webpage by interpreting HTML. JavaScript interpreter is used to interpret and execute JavaScript code on the website.
<br><br>
Here’s a little breakdown of what I just discussed…
 HTTP defines how text, images and videos are transmitted on the web. The data that is collected is translated through the browser engine. Data is read in HTML or through the JavaScript interpreter and finally, the client, the web browser reads the code in a way that we can see, hear, and watch things in the manner that is suitable for human beings.
When I look back at all the parts that work together to serve us what we watch, read and listen to on the internet, it’s pretty amazing. There are these processes that occur; however, we receive results back within seconds despite the different processes. Genuinely, what would we be without our middleman, Mr Web browser.
