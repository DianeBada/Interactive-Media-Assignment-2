At the start of this assignment, I was extremely excited on expanding my knowledge on building and designing websites. I have prior knowledge to building websites, but that was back in the beginning of high school. 
<br>
<p>
    The experience was real challenging and frustrating to say the least. When my lecturer Andre said that CSS can consume a lot of one’s time, he was not kidding. I had very specifics design layouts in my head that I had to tweak and adjust when building the website. I realised sometimes what you have in your head, won’t be the exact that on paper, in this case, on the web.
</p>
<br>
<p>However, what I really am proud of was how I grasped different knowledge based on Html and CSS. An example would be my blog page. Besides my portfolio page, this would be one of the most difficult layouts, to me, to do right. With that “exercise”, I genuinely discovered how div could be used as containers for other containers. Prior to this, I did not really have a solid idea on what divs or spans really were. This project really allowed me to pull tags apart and dissect them and really investigate their use and how they can be used for different things. The blog page gave me a bit of a hassle, but most importantly it showed me how I could align pictures right next to each other while simultaneously have a blog box for words right underneath it. With this I learnt a very important lesson, that sometimes you need to work from outwards in. So, starting with the bigger thing which was the container for both images and text to be in one container, then working on the positioning of the image and then finally making it to the blog box that needed to contain words about the blog.</p>
    <p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Secondly, another important lesson I learnt from this completion of this assignment, was working smart and not harder. By this I mean using the same CSS code for certain things. An example would be having certain words in the same font, same font-size and same colour. I would reuse the initial class name that I used to instantiate it in my style sheet. It saves time and is efficient. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>I discovered, playing around with code is the best thing to help you get to where you desire. I remember stumbling across an issue where my words were not aligning to the right of my image. I was so frustrated because I thought that I was getting somewhere. However, after playing around with different formatting properties such as float and margins, I got what I was looking for! One point to me! </p>
        
        <p>
            The more I coded, the more familiar I got with everything. My mind instantly clicked to what the next step should be. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            My most difficult challenge, was my portfolio page. This required some JavaScript, which I have a little bit of knowledge on. Even though I know JavaScript is not required for this project, I really wanted a little bit more of challenge before I finally called it a day. I went on a few websites to get an idea of what I wanted my portfolio page to resemble and finally after a few searches I came across it. To accomplish this, I had to read extensively through W3Schools, Stack Overflow and watch a few YouTube tutorials, however, after a day and a half, I finally got my desired outcome. It’s really fascinating to see how JavaScript can make things a little more interactive and more enjoyable on one’s website. However, what would I know? I’ve just touched the tip of the iceberg, there’s so much more to discover.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            One of my biggest concerns was how creative my website would look. I wouldn’t really say I have a creative bone in my body. Some might disagree, but for my that statement stands. I had to play around with a few colours to find a combination that I thought would be visually appealing. I had to think of how I could arrange different layouts, to not make it monotonous and to try aligning it on the creative side. What I think I did well, in terms of creativity, is my homepage. I just think you can’t miss it. To the colours of the worst contrasting the background to the very vivid picture of a girl flying in her bright red (brown to me) skin, really captures an audience.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Overall, I genuinely enjoyed this experience. In the few weeks that I’ve had to work on this project, I’ve seen how I’ve come a long way from the web-design student I was at the beginning of this project. It makes me really excited for the future and see what else I can do with the knowledge I attain throughout this module.
