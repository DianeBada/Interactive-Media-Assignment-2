    <p class = "e-content">UX represents User Experience: This area of website architecture winds around basic investigation and rationale to comprehend and anticipate a client's communication with items, frameworks, and administrations. It incorporates convenience, plan, route, and impression. Basically, it's tied in with making an extraordinary website architecture. UX configuration resembles the diagram of a house: it plans how to help individuals get in and out and starting with one room then onto the next.
        <br>
        UI represents User Interface: It's all the little meeting places between a client and a PC program, for this situation, my site. The connection point is a bunch of orders or menus that assist a client with speaking with the program. UI configuration decides how effectively and intuitively an individual can do on how they need to manage your site. UI configuration resembles the decorations and paint and little subtleties that summon the mood of a home
With regards to their disparities, extending these disciplines as independent hierarchical roles is significant. While UX is, even more, an information-driven projection of how the client is supposed to feel when on your site, UI thinks about the plan examples and, surprisingly, the minutest of subtleties.
 <br>
 In addition, UI configuration is tied in with making the format great and agreeable, though UX configuration concerns simplicity of utilization. UX is more an idea or rather an inclination that guarantees consistency, responsiveness, and the general reason for the site. Then again, UI includes components, apparatuses, specialized goodies, and computerized interfaces straightforwardly connected with the plan interaction.
 <br>
 <br>
 Personally, I always refer to the usability characteristics defined by the research company Nielsen Norman Group (Nielson, 2013).
Nielsen characterizes Usability through the accompanying five qualities: learnability, proficiency, memorability, mistakes, and fulfillment.
Learnability: Can the client finish their responsibilities with little trouble?
Efficiency: Does the connection point permit the client to finish responsibilities sooner rather than later? (Nielson, 2013).
Memorability: After leaving a site, how probably can the client recollect how to utilize it the following time they visit? (Nielson, 2013).
Errors: What steps does the point of interaction take to reduce the risk of client mistakes, and how would they allow the clients to address the errors?
Fulfillment: Does the user enjoy interacting with the design. (Nielson, 2013).
As to my site and the accompanying five characteristics recorded above, I believe that the learnability of the site was very direct for clients to utilize, in light of the schoolmates that had explored my site. The button was obviously marked, links were apparent and underlined, and pictures were obvious to see. Clients would have to simply click on the ideal area that they were keen on exploring.
<br>
<br>
As far as effectiveness, I would agree that most pages on the site considered clients to complete their obligations sooner than later. An illustration of this would be my style guide page. Clients have direct admittance to all the style decisions that were considered in the planning of my site without having to scroll through different pages for different information. All information on my design process is stated on one page. Where I figure I needed improvement would be my blog page. I found that according to Nielsen's nature of effectiveness, the blog page postponed the users from really getting to the blog. To move to the following entries, one would need to re-visit the first blog page to take a look at different sections or would need to look toward the end of a blog passage page to get to the connection to the following online blog entry. I thought about a method for combatting this issue, and that would be the consideration of a drop-down bar that has the entries for the different blog passages. This would decrease the time allotted to the client's actions. They presently have direct admittance to individual passages.
<br>
Ease of navigation is one of the premises of proper learnability. The web pages are characterized by the provision of a considerable amount of data including some outlines given on the top of the page. It is also important to note that it is easy to return to the home page or any other significant page by clicking on buttons in the nav bar presented in bright colors letters at the top of every web page. 

<br>
<br>
I really feel that I have achieved the assignment of memorability. Not exclusively is my page memorable as far as the plan and utilization of an appropriate color scheme, but in addition, as a result of the straightforwardness of the format and usefulness of the site. Clients for the most part cooperate with the top nav bar interacting with the site and navigating from one page then onto the next page. There are cases where new pages accompany new capacities and buttons, nonetheless, nothing is hazily named. I feel that when components within a site consolidated are obviously marked or named in close connection to their capacity inside the site, it would assist clients with making sure to get a handle on the capacity of the function of a little component corresponding to the sum of the site, which I assume I effectively did.
To no one’s surprise, there were errors in relation to the user experience and design of my website. Firstly, I noticed I had no footer, so things like texts and images would be at the very bottom of the page, often causing users to overlook them and miss them. Secondly, I noticed that some images were being squashed or dragged out, making them look unappealing to users. On top of that, I found that the paragraph used in my blog entries carried on across the entire page, making the reading process exhausting for users as it felt as if the reading time was dragged out. However, because of these errors, I could point out the areas that needed fixing and come up with solutions that will help users navigate the page/site in a better way.
Shockingly there were mistakes corresponding to the client experience and plan of my site. I, first and foremost, saw I had no footer, so things like texts and pictures would be at the actual lower part of the page, frequently making clients neglect it and miss it. Besides that, I saw that a few pictures were being crushed or hauled out, making them look unappealing to clients. In addition, I found that the section utilized in my blog passages carried on across the whole page, making the user's experience exhausting as it felt as if the reading time was hauled out. Nonetheless, due to these blunders, I could bring up the areas that required setting and think of arrangements that will assist clients with exploring the page/site in a superior way. In summary, my Interface has to be effective enough to comply with users’ goals. Satzinger et al. (2015) claim that people find all the elements (databases, hardware, and scripts) of a product irrelevant and develop their attitude towards the website based on its interface. An effective website will be designed in a way to foresee the user’s actions and desires and appropriately address them.
<br>
The fulfillment that should be evoked within users because of the web compositions, I feel is in progress, but not there yet. The criticism received from my lecturer congratulated me on the general look of my site and commended me on specific choices in format and design, nonetheless, I actually got criticism on similar format and construction on different parts of the site. Seeing as there are still objections, it implies that I haven't exactly met the satisfaction region. There are still things I need to pay further attention to, as referenced in the above paragraph about the mistakes found in order to leave users feeling satisfied after interacting with my websites. The overall design is also important for user satisfaction. Ji, Yun, Lee, Kim, and Lim (2017) emphasize that people’s cognitive and behavioral peculiarities should be analyzed when developing the interface. For instance, consistency can make users feel comfortable when using a product or be cautious and fixed on some areas. This resonates with my lecturer’s words when she suggested I carry on using the style I used to place my content in my style guide. She agrees that it’s a strong form of communication and brings familiarity to the users.

Elements I made use of in my Website 
<br>
<br>
Von Restorff Effect 
<br>
My Nav Bar includes various buttons that navigate clients to various pages, going from the homepage, blog page, style guide, and so on. They all appear to be identical, with the exception of the Portfolio page, as here I would like for clients' thoughtfulness regarding that button. This is where I would like them to survey my past works and potentially call me for future work. As indicated by the Von Restorff Effect, "when multiple similar objects are present, one that differs from the rest is most likely remembered" (Goldberg, 2022). This design was purposeful as I observed this guideline, to attempt to assist clients with recalling that my Portfolio page is unique in relation to different pages and that the page means quite a bit to see. I figure one thing that could be an issue with it, is that it is at the left end of the page. I will play around with the existing design of my nav-bar, to check whether I could find a preferred course of action over the one I have now.

<br>
<br>
CTA – Call to Action
<br>
On my homepage, I have a concise meaning of what's going on with the whole website, and I have a button there that is named "Explore" that prompts the client to click on it and investigate the sum of the page. This is the piece of content, known call to action, that "encourages the audience to do something" (Goldberg, 2022).
Later on, I might want to utilize more CTAs, particularly in my portfolio segment, as this would help in the route of the space inside the site. It would provide clients guidance and wouldn't permit them to have a lost or confused outlook on what to do. I think this was what I confronted particularly in my portfolio area, as clients were not exactly certain with respect to what they should do and the elements of specific parts there.

<br>
<br>
Alignment
<br>
“Good alignment is invisible, i.e., this doesn’t have to be a literal line in your design” (Goldberg, 2022). I think another concept that I struggled with, was good alignment, especially within my blog section. Good alignment was hard for me to accomplish, only due to the fact that I thought my blog entries were placed in a weird unflattering position. It did not look pleasing to the eyes and hence, I had to rearrange it and find some sort of balance between all elements placed on the screen.
<br><br>

Functionals vs Aesthetically pleasing?
<br>
“‘Should I design it to be functional,’ the students say, ‘or to be aesthetically pleasing?’ This is the most often heard, the most understandable, and yet the most mixed-up question in design today. ‘Do you want it to look good or to work?’ Barricades are erected between what are really just two of the many aspects of function.” (Papanek, 1984)
After reading through this reading, I had to really think about whether I wanted my website to be functional or “pretty”. Why couldn’t I have both? I saw that it was easier to make the website aesthetically pleasing than to have it fully functional. I also think that’s only because of proficiency in regard to actually coding with Html, JavaScript, and CSS. I feel that the functionality of the website will only improve from here onwards as my skills in making websites will increase over time. So, for the current moment, my website, I feel, is leaning more towards the aesthetic side. Also, I realized that this was my way of covering up things I’m lacking in terms of the functionality of the website.
